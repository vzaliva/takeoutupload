* Goolge Takout Upload

This program allows to import email archive (mbox file) produced by
[[https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout][Google Takout]] into another GMail account. While it is using IMAP
interface for import, unlike other scripts like [[https://imapsync.lamiral.info/][imapsync]] it uses GMail
IMAP extension preserving message labels.

Run without any flags to see usage information. See
/takeoutupload-example.cfg/ file for example config.

It is written as learning exercise in Haskell Pipes library.  It can
process maiboxes of arbitrary sizes in fixed memory footprint.
