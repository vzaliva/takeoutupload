* Goolge Takeout Upload

This script allows to import email archive (/mbox/ file) produced by
[[https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout][Google Takeout]] into another GMail account. While it is using IMAP
protocol for import, unlike other scripts which use only standard IMAP
protocol it uses GMail IMAP extensions to preserve message
labels. Additionally it implements some gmail-specific workarounds for
bugs in Gmail IMAP.

Run without any flags to see usage information. See
/takeoutupload-example.cfg/ file for sample config.

It is written as learning exercise in Haskell Pipes library. It can
process maiboxes of arbitrary size in fixed memory footprint. In case
of error, run with /-d/ commad line option to see IMAP session
transcript.
